<h1> VR Gene Mining </h1>
<p>
A Unity implemented simulation and mining program intended for use with gene or protein microarray expression data.</br>
Uses decentralized K-Means clustering to group datapoints to centroids and force directed layout to distribute</br>
the gameobjects in the scene.</p>
<p>
The VR Gene Mining program can form association links between datapoints loaded in the scene by</br>
loading an association list file corrisponding to records in the data file.</br>
The RESTful Association Grabber GUI can be used to build full association lists given </br>
a microarray expression dataset. </p>
<p>
Dataset testing was performed on microarray testing data accessed from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds"> NCBI GEO Datasets </a> </br>
Association data is retrieved using the RESTful Association Grabber GUI and accessed through <a href="https://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/biogridrest">BioGRID REST Service</a></br>
